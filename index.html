<h1>D&D Character Viewer</h1>

<p>
    There are countless websites/apps for digitally storing information on your
    D&D characters. What makes this one better than the rest? This one is mine!
</p>
<p>
    The main reason I built this website was to have a free (and ad-free)
    solution to manage the spell lists for each of my characters. As such, all
    you can configure for each character is a short bio and spell list. It's
    unlikely that I'll add more functionality to this website in the future, but
    you never know! In the meantime, I find the spell search functionality to be
    very good, so I hope you can also find that useful!
</p>
<p>
    This website is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. It is
    integrated with <a href='https://prose.io/'>prose.io</a> to enable easy
    editing of the markdown content of the site if using an IDE isn't your cup
    of tea.
</p>
<p>
    This website is only designed to store profiles on my own characters. If you
    want to store your own characters you can
    <a href='{{site.github-repo-url}}'>fork the repository</a>
    and then follow the instructions in the
    <a href='{{site.github-repo-url}}/blob/gh-pages/README.md'>README file</a>
    to alter the site as you wish.
</p>

<h2>My Characters</h2>
<ul>
    {% for character in site.characters %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{character.url}}">{{character.name}}</a>
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
