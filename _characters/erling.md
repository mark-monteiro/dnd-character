Erling "Blevins" Shortwick was once but a simple halfling farmer, enjoying the simple life
of family, friends and food. That simple life was abruptly ended the fateful night his
sorcerous powers were revealed. The death and destruction wraught that night by his
own hands left a scar on his soul. One that will perhaps never fully heal. The full story is
one of grief and suffering that only a few close companions have ever heard.

However, it would appear that the twists of fate are still not done with young Erling.
Even now as he completes his training at the House of Wonders in Waterdeep and gains control
over his powers, a new catalysm rises to meet him. But Erling is no longer the helpless
villager of his past; though he may appear small, the enemies that emerge to face him now
would be wise to fear his newly mastered power.
