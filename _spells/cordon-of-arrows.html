<p>You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunitionΓÇöarrows or crossbow boltsΓÇöin the ground within range and lay magic upon them to protect an area. Until the spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition remains.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can designate any creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them.</p>
