A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range.
Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
</br>
When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time
on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a
Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
</br>
A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form
and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spells light.
</br>
On each of your turns after you cast this
spell use can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.
</br>
At Higher Levels. When you cast this
spell using a spell slot 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
