A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.
On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
</br>
In addition, unsecured objects
that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s effect,
and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
</br>
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
