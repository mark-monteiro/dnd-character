<p>Dark writhing tentacles occupy the ground in a square of 90 feet ridge you can see the range of the spell. For the duration of the spell, the tentacles make the difficult terrain.</p><p>When a creature enters the affected area for the first time in a turn or where it begins its turn, it must make a dexterity saving throw or it suffers 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is hampered by tentacles until the end of the spell. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already hampered by the tentacles suffers 3d6 bludgeoning damage.</p><p>A creature hampered by the tentacles can use his action to a test Strength or Dexterity (at its option) opposite to the SD backup of your fate. If successful, it is free.</p>
